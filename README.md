PHP Value Objects
=================

master [![master branch build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/gws/php-valueobjects.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gws/php-valueobjects)

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object) has a pretty good
general explanation of value objects.

Since these are pretty straightforward, just check the tests to get some ideas
on how to use these classes.
